<h1>
Runtime Host Sample</h1>

<span class="openfloat"><a href="PostSharp.Samples.Host.sln"><img src="../vs.png" border="0" alt="">Open this sample in Visual Studio</a> </span>

<p>This sample demonstrates how to host PostSharp in an
application
that performs runtime weaving. This would be the case for instance of
an application server that weaves components before loading them in the
server.</p>


<p>The sample explains how different application domain interact.
It
shows how to work with deep-first assembly processing and assembly name
overwriting.</p>


<p>The characteristics of this sample host are:</p>


<ul>


  <li>Only assemblies present in the same directory as the entry
point assembly (typically the <code>.exe</code>) are woven.</li>


  <li>Assemblies are processed in deep-first order of references.
That is, <i>referenced</i> assemblies are processed before
    <i>referencing</i> ones. That means also that
assemblies are not <i>lazily</i> woven, which would be
another design decision (yet possible as well).</li>


</ul>


<h2>Concept</h2>


<p>When you develop an aspect or a plug-in, your code is
instantiated
and invoked by PostSharp. However, when you develop a PostSharp Host,
your code instantiate and invoke PostSharp.</p>


<p>PostSharp comes with two hosts: the MSBuild task and the
command-line utility. This sample illustrates how to develop a host
that weaves assemblies at runtime, that is, to be precise, just before
they are loaded in the application domain (<code>AppDomain</code>).</p>


<h3>Application Domains</h3>


<p>Three application domains live in the host process:</p>


<ul>


  <li>The <b>system application domain</b> is
initially created when the process started. It creates and controls
both other application domains.</li>


  <li>The <b>client application domain</b> contains
the client
application. Assemblies forming the client application are loaded in
this application domain after having been transformed by PostSharp.</li>


  <li>The <b>PostSharp application domain</b> is
where PostSharp resides and where transformations are executed.</li>


</ul>


<h3>The Host Class</h3>


<p>An application that hosts PostSharp should implement the <code>IPostSharpHost</code>
interface. PostSharp calls back this interface when it needs to resolve
an assembly reference (<code>ResolveAssemblyReference</code>
method) or to know how an assembly should be processed (i.e. with which
PostSharp project and which parameters; <code>GetProjectInvocationParameters</code>
method), or when a message is emitted (<code>OnMessage</code>
method).</p>


<p>In our sample, the <code>IPostSharpHost</code>
interface is implemented by the <code>Host</code> class.
Additionally, this class has an <code>Execute</code>
method that sets up the client application domain and invoke PostSharp.</p>


<h3>The LocalHost Class</h3>


PostSharp offers the possibility to have a host-defined class laying
between PostSharp and the system application domain. This is useful if
you want to react to some events, or perform assembly reference
resolving, in the application domain of PostSharp. This enables you to
have access to the complete object model of PostSharp. This host object
is called <i>local</i> because it resides in the same
application domain as PostSharp. The default implementation is <code>PostSharpLocalHost</code>.
In this sample, we demonstrated how to override it. We defined the
class <code>LocalHost</code> that registers to some event
and simply log to the console. Event handlers are registered in the <code>Initialize</code>
method.<br>


<h3>The ClientDomainManager class</h3>


<p>The <code>ClientDomainManager</code> class
manages the client application domain. An instance of this object is
created by the <code>Host</code> object just after it
creates the client application domain. The principal role of this
object is to handle the <code>AppDomain.AssemblyResolve</code>
event so that it provides the assembly transformed by PostSharp instead
of the unmodified assembly.&nbsp;</p>


<p>In order to achieve this, there is a close cooperation between
the <code>Host</code> and the <code>ClientDomainManager</code>
objects. The <code>ClientDomainManager</code> object
maintains a dictionary that associates an <code>AssemblyName</code>
to a location on the file system. This file could be transformed by
PostSharp or not; it is not relevant for <code>ClientDomainManager</code>.
The <code>Host</code> object should call the <code>ClientDomainManager.SetAssemblyLocation</code>
method after the assembly.&nbsp;Because
we chose to weave all assemblies present in the same directory as the
entry point assembly, and only them, it is sufficient to call the <code>SetAssemblyLocation</code>
method once we have ordered the transformation of the assembly, that
is, in the <code>Host.GetInvocationParameters</code>
method.</p>


<p>Another role of the <acronym>ClientDomainManager</acronym>
class it
to invoke the entry point of the method level. This is nearly trivial,
but one should not forget to set up the proper thread apartment. This
is done by the <code>Execute</code> method.</p>


<h3>Renaming Woven Assemblies</h3>


<p>Remember that we use the <code>AppDomain.AssemblyResolve</code>
event to tell the runtime engine to load our woven assembly instead of
the initial, unmodified assembly. However, this even is only a <i>fallback</i>
mechanism. That is, it is called only when the required assembly is not
found using the default probing mechanism. So we cannot know with
certitude that we will get the chance to have our event handler called.</p>


<p>In order to circumvent this issue, PostSharp renames woven
assemblies (this feature is named <i>assembly name overwriting</i>).
The result is that the default probing algorithm of the runtime engine
always fails, so the <code>AssemblyResolve</code> event is
always raised and we get always the opportunity to load our woven
version of the assembly.</p>


<p>When PostSharp renames an assembly, it calls the <code>RenameAssembly</code>
method of the <code>Host</code> object. This method, in
turn, propagates the renaming in the <code>ClientDomainManager</code>
object.</p>
